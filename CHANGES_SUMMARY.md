# Summary of Changes for PR #12

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented based on the review feedback for PR #12.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Target Directory Removal
- Removed all build artifacts from repository
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- Prevents future accidental commits of build files

### 2. ✅ Complete Ring Buffer Rewrite
- Removed dependency on `ringbuf` crate
- Implemented custom SPSC ring buffer from scratch
- Added `#[repr(align(64))]` for cache-line padding
- Implemented power-of-two capacity validation
- Used relaxed atomics with acquire-release ordering
- Zero allocations in hot path using `MaybeUninit`

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive API
- Added `capacity()` - returns buffer capacity
- Added `len()` - returns number of items in buffer
- Added `is_empty()` - checks if buffer is empty
- Added `is_full()` - checks if buffer is full
- Added `remaining_capacity()` - returns available space
- Proper error handling with custom error types

### 4. ✅ Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
- Included thread safety guarantees
- Added performance characteristics
- Provided usage examples
- Documented panic conditions

### 5. ✅ Testing
- Added Loom-based concurrency tests for memory ordering
- Added property-based tests using proptest
- Added comprehensive edge case tests
- Added stress tests for wraparound behavior
- Added memory barrier verification tests

### 6. ✅ Benchmarks
- Added Criterion benchmarks for throughput measurement
- Added latency percentile measurements
- Added performance validation example
- Tests various buffer sizes and value types
- Includes contention scenarios

### 7. ✅ Other Fixes
- Removed placeholder code from lib.rs
- Fixed Rust edition (2024 → 2021)
- Removed incompatible Cargo.lock
- Fixed all review comments

## Performance

The implementation is designed to achieve ≥20M operations per second through:
- Cache-line alignment to prevent false sharing
- Relaxed memory ordering where safe
- Power-of-two capacity for efficient masking
- Zero allocations in the hot path

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite once Cargo index updates complete
2. Execute benchmarks to verify performance targets
3. Run Loom tests to validate memory ordering
